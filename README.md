# Description
We will cover the current most popular time-series database, InfluxDB with its key principles, diverse use cases, comprehensive tutorial, and critical analysis including strengths, weaknesses, licensing terms, community base, and more. We will also go over its unique UI to answer why InfluxDB’s simple yet informative design to specialize in time series has an advantage over its Relational Database counterpart. Our goal for this report is to introduce and educate the idea of InfluxDB for readers to apply it practically in the future.
